Scripts for self-restarting slurm jobs for continous (daemon-like) and periodic (cron-like) jobs.

- **Continuous job** (daemon-like): Run new job immediately after the current job has exited successfully.
- **Periodic job** (cron-like): Run new job at specified date after the current job has exited successfully.

The scripts are templates and the parameters must be tuned to the use-case.
